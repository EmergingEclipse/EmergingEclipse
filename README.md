### Hi there Welcome Traveler, Make a fire ðŸ”¥ and stay a while ðŸ‘‹

My name is Caleb Millard, I am a Software Developer based in British Columbia, Canada. I love making games and designing UI. I have worked on multiple mid size projects. My most recent published project is Project B, a 2-D plaform stratagy game. My expertise is in frontend UI/UX design and implementation as well as systems development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few things:
1. Some exciting projects unfortunately covered under NDA
2. A new game with some of my fellow alumni and seniors from my alma mater.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on understanding more about:
1. Encryption and cyber security
2. How to properly design an anticheat system

- ðŸ‘¯ Things I might be interested in collaborating on:
1. Games specifically 2-D, open to 3-D but less experienced
2. Cyber security projects
3. UI UX Design or implementation

I found a way to use steganography to encode and decode images in a near unhackable way with more discrete ways of transporting information and programs via imaging.
